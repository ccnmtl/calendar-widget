While it may be the standard way to teach equation-heavy courses, there are multiple methods which surpass lectures in the ability to engage students with the course content. This workshop will discuss strategies to help you move away from the board so you can spend more time interacting with your students and directly facilitate their learning experience. We will investigate the pedagogy of active learning and identify steps that will allow you to transition from a traditional lecture to interactive lectures or blended learning, especially in a Science, Technology, Engineering, or Mathematics (STEM) course. \n\nThis workshop will be facilitated by Stephanie Gillespie, VIP Graduate Mentor at the Georgia Institute of Technology.\n\nColumbia University makes every effort to accommodate individuals with disabilities.

This introductory workshop will cover: basic tenets of engaged scholarship and service-learning; how community engagement benefits student learning; relating service-learning to your course objectives; and getting started with your own project.","xproperties":[{"X-BEDEWORK-WAIT-LIST-LIMIT":{"values":{"text":"null"}}},{"X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS":{"values":{"text":"\/user\/agrp_calsuite-centertla\/Category\/Education"}}},{"X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS":{"values":{"text":"\/user\/agrp_calsuite-centertla\/Type\/Workshop"}}},{"X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS":{"values":{"text":"\/user\/agrp_calsuite-centertla\/Events open to\/Faculty"}}},{"X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS":{"values":{"text":"\/user\/agrp_calsuite-centertla\/Location\/Morningside"}}},{"X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS":{"values":{"text":"\/user\/agrp_calsuite-centertla\/Events open to\/Postdocs"}}},{"X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS":{"values":{"text":"\/user\/agrp_calsuite-centertla\/Events open to\/Staff"}}},{"X-BEDEWORK-ALIAS":{"values":{"text":"\/user\/agrp_calsuite-centertla\/Group-Specific\/TIP"}}},{"X-BEDEWORK-THUMB-IMAGE":{"values":{"text":"\/public\/images\/engagedscholarship525-8097e514-96da-413e-af68-ac543e6b3717-201612210134-thumb.png"}}},{"X-BEDEWORK-IMAGE":{"values":{"text":"\/public\/images\/engagedscholarship525-8097e514-96da-413e-af68-ac543e6b3717-201612210134.jpg"}}},{"X-BEDEWORK-MAX-TICKETS-PER-USER":{"values":{"text":"1"}}},{"X-BEDEWORK-REGISTRATION-END":{"values":{"text":"20170228T113000"}}},{"X-BEDEWORK-MAX-TICKETS":{"values":{"text":"30"}}},{"X-BEDEWORK-REGISTRATION-START":{"values":{"text":"20161221T113000"}}},{"X-BEDEWORK-SUBMITTEDBY":{"values":{"text":"cke2109 for Center For Teaching and Learning (agrp_centertla)"}}},{"X-BEDEWORK-ADDITIONAL-INFO":{"values":{"text":"Columbia University makes every effort to accommodate individuals with disabilities.
